<h1>Research</h1>
<div>
<p>
My research journey in Master program started by working on a project that attempted to Internt of thing. The work yield an accepted paper in The International Conference for  International Conference on Soft Computing and Data Mining (SCDM 2018), Johor, Malaysia, February 06-07, 2018 that has been nominated for best paper. I was working mainly on the part of this work that focused on Internt of things.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.A thing, in the Internet of Things, can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low -- or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an IP address and provided with the ability to transfer data over a network. IoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), microservices and the internet. The convergence has helped tear down the silo walls between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), allowing unstructured machine-generated data to be analyzed for insights that will drive improvements.
